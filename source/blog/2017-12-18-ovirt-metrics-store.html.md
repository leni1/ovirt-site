The oVirt project now includes a unified metrics and logs real-time monitoring solution for the oVirt environment.

Using Elasticsearch - a search and analytics engine - and its native visualization layer, Kibana, we now provide oVirt project users with a fully functional monitoring solution.

The solution includes self-service dashboards for creating your own dashboard, reports, and log analysis for both the engine and VDSM logs.

Combining Elasticsearch and kibana - both built on top of the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) - with the collectd and fluentd client-side daemons, results in a powerful end-to-end solution.
